            <p class="split-text">What does it mean to change one's mind? Not just to adopt a new opinion—but to renovate one's whole understanding of reality itself? This is what I set out to discover as I explored the renaissance of psychedelic research and its potential to transform our understanding of consciousness.</p>

        <div class="text">
          <p class="split-text">Before LSD was demonized and pushed underground, it enjoyed a brief but promising career as a psychiatric wonder drug. From the 1950s through the mid-1960s, more than a thousand clinical papers were published, reporting on treatments for a wide variety of conditions.</p>
          <p class="split-text">Today, after decades of prohibition, scientists are rediscovering the therapeutic potential of these compounds. Modern research at institutions like Johns Hopkins and Imperial College London has demonstrated remarkable efficacy for treating depression, addiction, and end-of-life anxiety.</p>

          <div class="text">
            <p class="split-text">Rather than activating the brain, as was long assumed, psychedelics actually diminish activity in certain regions—particularly the default mode network (DMN), a collection of linked brain regions that generates our sense of self.</p>
            <p class="split-text">When the DMN goes quiet, the usual boundaries we experience—between self and other, subject and object—begin to dissolve.</p>

        <div class="text">
          <p class="split-text">The evidence suggests that a carefully guided psychedelic experience can help people break out of rigid thought patterns and destructive behaviors that have resisted years of conventional therapy.</p>
          <p class="split-text">This power to "shake the snow globe" of the mind offers hope not just for treating disorders, but for expanding our conception of human potential. By revealing the constructed nature of the self and reconnecting us to a sense of unity with others and the natural world, psychedelics may help us address the epidemic of disconnection that underlies many of our social and environmental crises.</p>
